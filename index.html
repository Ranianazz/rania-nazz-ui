          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This page will display an analysis of two experimental interactive
            web-based experiences: <strong>Orb.Farm</strong> by Max Bittker and
            <strong>Holdspace</strong> by Carlos Yusim. Both of these projects
            Invite users into an interactive, audiovisual environment, however
            They take different approaches to their interaction design.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Information Design</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Orb.Farm</strong> displays a simulation of a fishbowl with
            no obvious instructions upfront. The users discover elements such
            as: water, fish, and grass by interacting with it freely. The lack
            of instructions encourages exploration, but it at the same time it
            may confuse first-time users.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Holdspace</strong> is a minimal interactive web-based
            experience. A black screen with subtle visual effects. The only clue
            is the prompt to press the spacebar. As users press or hold space,
            audio plays, and a loading bar at the top indicates progress. The 3d
            The image is intentionally abstract, guiding users via sound and
            movement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Comparison:</strong> Orb.Farm hides a lot of information to
            encourage experimentation. While Holdspace simplifies it to one
            clear interaction with a focus on sensory feedback. Orb has no
            guide; Holdspace has a guide on how to use it.
          </p>

          <h2>Mapping</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Orb.Farm</strong> utilises standard point and click mapping
            with a drag and drop tool to place elements with the mouse. Some
            tools aren't obvious at first, but over time, the interface feels
            clear.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Holdspace</strong> depends on a single button, the spacebar.
            When you tap it, individual sounds play. Hold it, and the full track
            plays. The mapping is direct, intuitive, and tightly tied to the
            experience’s concept.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Comparison:</strong> Orb.Farm requires a lot of trial and
            error to understand the control mappings. Meanwhile, Holdspace’s
            single-key input makes the experience feel immediate and accessible.
          </p>

          <h2>Characterisation</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Orb.Farm</strong>, this retro experience feels like a
            digital fishbowl with its peaceful, experimental element that
            invites calm curiosity. The visuals are pixelated and charming, with
            a DIY, open-ended character.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Holdspace</strong> gives a sense of an art piece. With its
            aesthetic that is a sleek and moody. It leans into minimalism,
            mystery, and atmosphere. The character is reflective, almost
            meditative.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Comparison:</strong> Orb.Farm encourages active and creative
            play. However, Holdspace creates an emotional, ambient mood with
            minimal input. One is playful and structural; the other is ambient
            and sensory.
          </p>

          <h2>Feedback</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Orb.Farm</strong> gives visual feedback on the objects
            animation, and Changes over time. However, there isn't much
            immediate response to the users actions. Changes are slow, making it
            look like natural processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Holdspace</strong> gives instant audio and visual feedback.
            When Tapping space it gives sound and animation. When holding space
            it activates the loading bar, building anticipation. It’s fast,
            clear, and emotionally engaging.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Comparison:</strong> Orb.Farm uses subtle, delayed feedback.
            Meanwhile Holdspace responds immediately. This reflects their
            different goals: simulation versus sensory experience.
