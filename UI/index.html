          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This page analyses and contrasts the interaction design of two
            experimental web-based experiences: <strong>Orb.Farm</strong> by Max
            Bittker and <strong>Holdspace</strong> by Carlos Yusim. Both
            projects invite users into interactive, audiovisual environments,
            but they take very different approaches to interaction design.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Information Design</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Orb.Farm</strong> presents a simulation of a living fishbowl
            with no instructions upfront. Users discover its elements — water,
            fish, grass — by interacting freely. The lack of instructions
            encourages exploration, but it may confuse first-time users.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Holdspace</strong> is minimal: a black screen with subtle
            visual effects. The only clue is the prompt to press the spacebar.
            As users press or hold space, audio plays and a loading bar at the
            top indicates progress. It’s abstract, but intentionally so, guiding
            users via sound and movement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Comparison:</strong> Orb.Farm hides information to reward
            experimentation. Holdspace simplifies it to one clear interaction
            with focused sensory feedback. Orb is more sandbox; Holdspace is
            more guided.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Mapping</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Orb.Farm</strong> uses standard point-and-click mapping —
            drag, drop, and place elements with the mouse. Some tools aren't
            immediately obvious, but over time, the interface feels natural for
            sandbox play.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Holdspace</strong> relies on a single key: the spacebar. Tap
            it, and individual sounds play. Hold it, and the full track unfolds.
            The mapping is direct, intuitive, and tightly tied to the
            experience’s concept.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Comparison:</strong> Orb.Farm requires trial-and-error to
            understand control mappings. Holdspace’s single-key input makes the
            experience feel immediate and accessible.
          </p>

          <h2>Characterisation</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Orb.Farm</strong> feels like a digital terrarium — peaceful,
            experimental, and slightly retro. It invites calm curiosity. The
            visuals are pixelated and charming, with a DIY, open-ended
            character.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Holdspace</strong> feels like an art piece. Its aesthetic is
            sleek and moody. It leans into minimalism, mystery, and atmosphere.
            The character is reflective, almost meditative.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Comparison:</strong> Orb.Farm encourages active, creative
            tinkering. Holdspace creates an emotional, ambient mood with minimal
            input. One is playful and systemic; the other is poetic and sensory.
          </p>

          <h2>Feedback</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Orb.Farm</strong> gives visual feedback — objects animate,
            grow, or change over time. However, there's little immediate
            response to user actions. Changes are slow, mirroring natural
            processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Holdspace</strong> gives instant audio and visual feedback.
            Tapping space gives sound and animation. Holding space triggers a
            loading bar, building anticipation. It’s fast, clear, and
            emotionally engaging.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Comparison:</strong> Orb.Farm uses subtle, delayed feedback.
            Holdspace responds immediately. This reflects their different goals:
            simulation versus sensory experience.
